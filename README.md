## Abstract

Urban vegetation monitoring plays a vital role in understanding environmental changes and pro
moting sustainable development, yet comprehensive datasets for this purpose remain limited. To address this gap, we present the Temporal Remote-sensing Repository for Analyzing Change Detection (TERRA-CD), a benchmark dataset comprising 5,221 paired Sentinel-2 images from 232 cities across the USA and Europe. The dataset features three distinct annotation schemes: 4 class land cover mapping masks, 3-class vegetation change masks, and 13-class semantic change masks capturing all land cover transitions. Using various deep learning approaches including Siamese networks, STANet variants, Post-Classification Comparison, and HRSCD strategies, we evaluated the dataset’s effectiveness for both vegetation Multi-class Change Detection (MCD) as well as Semantic Change Detection (SCD). Our experiments achieved notable results, with these models averaging 97.5% accuracy and 65.7% kappa score for vegetation MCD, while SCD results averaged 93.2% accuracy and 57.1% kappa score. These results demonstrate TERRA-CD’s value as a versatile benchmark dataset for developing and evaluating urban vegetation monitoring systems and broader land cover change detection applications.
